# Smart Road Simulation 🚗🛣️

A Rust-based simulation of an autonomous vehicle intersection management system, inspired by the Rust Piscine project. This version uses SDL2 to render a visual cross intersection and will feature smart traffic logic without traffic lights.

## 📦 Features

- Top-down cross intersection with 3 lanes in each direction
- SDL2 rendering for roads and lane markings
- Autonomous vehicles with different routes (left, straight, right)
- Smart velocity-based traffic control (coming soon)
- Simulation statistics and safe distance enforcement (coming soon)

## 🧰 Built With

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [SDL2](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2)
- [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) (for SDL2 C++ dependencies)
- [cargo-watch](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-watch) (optional, for hot dev loop)
